#Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of Haskell! I'm pretty happy that you've chosen *me* to be your tour guide on this trip. I should probably confess right away that I'm learning Haskell while writing this, so if that hasn't scared you away already, I hope you will find this a useful resource.

I have found Haskell to be an absolute pleasure to work with, despite how, well, different it can feel. There's also the fear that you will love Haskell *so* much that you can never return to your old friends, the imperative languges. If Haskell happens to be your first language, awesome!

I decided to learn Haskell as a purely interest driven pursuit. I don't need it for any of my classes, I likely won't get hired to work in it (though I hope I do), and I'm not going to get much street cred from people that are reading "Build an iOS app in 27.9 seconds." As a result, I can really delve into the language and get what I want out of it. What that is exactly, I'm not sure, but hopefully by the end of this book we'll both know what *that* is, if you don't know already!

I hope that you will find this book to be an enjoyable read. There are other great resources out there that can help you learn Haskell, so I hope that even if this isn't the book for you, you will still give Haskell a chance. This book is going to be an iterative process for the forseeable future, as I would like to add better content and exercises. So check back often and kick me in the butt if I start to slack off.

Without further ado, let's begin!
